# Awesome CakePHP
A curated list of amazingly awesome CakePHP plugins, resources and shiny things.

Also see http://plugins.cakephp.org/packages/categories as a categorized list
and maybe check out the PHP list at https://github.com/ziadoz/awesome-php as well.

This list is specifically for **CakePHP2.x**. For *CakePHP3.x* please see the *cake3* branch.
It is a recommendation for good plugins and solutions for this major CakePHP version.

The main advantage of this list compared to plugins.cakephp.org is, that here it can also be
a subpart of a plugin - instead of only the whole plugin/repo itself. The grouping might also be more granular.
Focus is on the specific task.
