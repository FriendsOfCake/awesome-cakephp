# Awesome CakePHP
A curated list of amazingly awesome CakePHP plugins, resources and shiny things.

Also see [plugins.cakephp.org/packages/categories](http://plugins.cakephp.org/packages/categories) as a categorized list.
You may also want to check out the PHP list at [awesome-php](https://github.com/dereuromark/awesome-php) as well as the generic
[awesome-awesomeness](https://github.com/dereuromark/awesome-awesomeness) list.

This list is specifically for **CakePHP2.x** (for *CakePHP3.x* please see the *cake3* branch).
It is a recommendation for good plugins and solutions for this major CakePHP version.

The main advantage of this list compared to plugins.cakephp.org is, that here it can also be
a subpart of a plugin - instead of only the whole plugin/repo itself. The grouping might also be more granular.
Focus is on the specific task.
